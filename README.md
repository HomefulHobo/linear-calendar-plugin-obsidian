## ⚠️ Development Status

This plugin is in **early development** and may undergo significant changes. The core functionality—how notes are recognized and dates are extracted—will remain stable. If you use properties or dates in filenames, these will continue to work.

New features are actively being developed. If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/HomefulHobo/linear-calendar-plugin-obsidian/) or via [e-mail](https://www.homefulhobo.com/contact/).

This plugin is being developed with the help of AI.

### 🔍 Flexible Date Extraction

Extract dates from multiple sources with customizable priority:

**Start Date Sources:**
- Properties (configurable, checked in order)
- Filename (first YYYY-MM-DD pattern)
- Choose which source takes priority when both are available

**End Date Sources (for multi-day events):**
- Properties (configurable, checked in order)
- Filename (second YYYY-MM-DD pattern)
- Choose which source takes priority when both are available

**Examples:**
```yaml
---
date: 2024-01-15
date_end: 2024-01-20
---
```

Or use filenames:
- `2024-01-15 Meeting.md` → Single-day note on Jan 15
- `2024-01-15 – 2024-01-20 Conference.md` → Multi-day event Jan 15-20

### 🎨 Customization Options

**Calendar Appearance:**
- **Fit to screen**: Calendar adjusts to available width (default)
- **Scrollable**: Fixed cell widths with horizontal scrolling
- **Configurable cell width**: Set minimum cell width (20-200px) for scrollable mode

**Display Options:**
- Show/hide daily notes in calendar cells
- Show/hide notes with date + text in title
- Optional date hiding: Display "Meeting Notes" instead of "2024-01-15 Meeting Notes"

### 🔎 Advanced Filtering

Filter which notes appear in the calendar:

**Filter Modes:**
- **Show all notes**: Display every note with a valid date (default)
- **Include mode**: Only show notes matching ALL conditions
- **Exclude mode**: Hide notes matching ALL conditions

**Available Conditions:**
- File properties (name, folder, path, extension)
- Custom frontmatter properties
- Text operators: is, contains, starts with, ends with, regex
- Special operators: exists, has tag, matches date pattern

**Example Use Cases:**
- Only show notes in "Projects" folder
- Exclude notes tagged with #draft
- Show only notes with a specific property
